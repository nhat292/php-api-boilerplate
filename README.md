# PHP API Boilerplate

This is an example of what an API written in PHP without using any library or framework (but still with OOP, URI routing in the code, dependency injection and friends) would look like.

## How to run this?

* Insider your working copy (where you cloned this repo), run `php -S localhost:8080 web/index.php` (TIP: if you are using a Mac, the bundled php version seems to work well, but if you want to install php7, `brew install php72`.
